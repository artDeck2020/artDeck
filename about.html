<h1>About</h1>    
<p class="text-justify">The purpose of ArtDeck is to expand our conversations about art beyond the gallery.</p>
<p class="text-justify">We’re responding to three main problems:</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-11-21/australian-women-artists-national-gallery-of-australia/12890818">Women artists aren’t as well known as their male counterparts.</a> There's also <a href="https://ocula.com/magazine/conversations/redressing-gender-imbalance-at-national-gallery/">no good data on non-binary representation at all</a>.</li>
  <li>People aren’t super-engaged in art, even when they go to galleries. The average time spending looking at a gallery artwork <a href="https://www.art-critique.com/en/2019/04/the-average-person-spends-27-seconds-looking-at-a-work-of-art-slow-art-day-is-hoping-to-change-that/">is only 27 seconds</a>. People struggle with knowing ‘how’ to look at art, what to look for, what different elements mean, and understanding what moves and appeals to them.</li>
  <li>There's a gender gap in artist payments and commissions - for example, in Australia, <a href="https://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/research/the-gender-pay-gap-among-australian-artists/">women earn 30 percent less from their creative work</a>.</li></ul>
<p class="text-justify">Our solution is featuring underrepresented artists in a deck of cards - available both as an app and a physical game. On one side of the card will be an image of an artwork, and on the other side will be some information about the work, and the artist. We’ll also include a conversation starting question to allow users to engage with the art on their own terms, and in casual settings, and with friends.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The artists we feature would receive direct royalties from deck and app sales. There would also be indirect benefits for them. We’ll provide links to artists’ social media profiles, to encourage users to follow artists. ~52% of art collectors purchased art from someone they followed on Instagram. Artists can also leverage their Instagram following for opportunities like being featured in galleries, commissions, and people’s choice contests.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The decks would also be released with podcasts/social media live events showcasing conversations generated by the deck with a mix of people both art experts and non-experts, so people can see what playing the game is like, and can access these conversations even if they don’t buy the deck/download the app.</p>
